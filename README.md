# Strategy game

## What even is this
This is a project that was supposed to check our abilities in writing multi-threaded applications.
## Why do this now
I never finished that project and I wanted to write some C code for fun, and this looked like a great idea.
## How does it work?
Right now it doesn't really do anything- it only generates some resources.
I wanted to recall how to use pipes, forks etc., which I did, and now I'm rearranging code, so it won't become an unreadable mess.
